//! Ed would like a way to calculate an age from a given birth date.
//* Export a function that will take 3 arguments - a **year**, a **month**, and a **day** - then return an accurate age.
//* For example, `ageCalculator(2000, 12, 25)` should return the age of someone born on Christmas Day, 2000.

export function ageCalculator() {
